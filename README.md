#Car Counter ðŸš—ðŸ“Š
This project is a real-time vehicle detection and counting system built using YOLO (You Only Look Once), a deep learning-based object detection model. It accurately detects and tracks cars in video feeds, making it useful for traffic analysis, smart city applications, and parking management. By leveraging deep learning, the system ensures precise vehicle recognition, enabling better traffic monitoring, congestion analysis, and automation in transportation systems.
